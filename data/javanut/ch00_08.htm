<P CLASS=para>
Many people helped in the creation of this book and I am
grateful to them all.  I am indebted to literally hundreds
of readers of the first edition who wrote in with comments,
suggestions, bug reports, and praise.  Their many small
contributions are scattered throughout the book.  Also, my
apologies to those who made the many good suggestions that
could not be incorporated into this edition.

<P CLASS=para>
Paula Ferguson, a friend and colleague, edited both editions
of the book. Her careful reading and always-practical
suggestions made the book stronger, clearer, and more
useful.  She is also the one who prodded me when I started
to slack off, and got me back on track when I started trying
to turn <I CLASS=emphasis>Java in a Nutshell</I> into <I CLASS=emphasis>Java in a Packing
Crate</I>.

<P CLASS=para>
Mike Loukides provided high-level direction and guidance for
the first edition of the book.  Eric Raymond and Troy
Downing reviewed that first edition--they helped spot my
errors and omissions, and offered good advice on making the
book more useful to Java programmers.

<P CLASS=para>
For the second edition, John Zukowski reviewed my Java 1.1
AWT quick-reference material, and George Reese reviewed most
of the remaining new material.  This edition was also
blessed with a "dream team" of technical reviewers from
Sun.  John Rose, the author of the Java Inner Classes
Specification, reviewed the chapter on inner classes.  Mark
Reinhold, author of the character stream classes in
<tt CLASS=literal>java.io</tt>, reviewed my documentation of these classes.
Nakul Saraiya, the designer of the new Java Reflection API,
reviewed my documentation of the <tt CLASS=literal>java.lang.reflect</tt>
package.  I am very grateful to these engineers and
architects; their efforts have made this a stronger, more
accurate book. Any errors that remain are of course my own.

<P CLASS=para>
Nicole Gipson Arigo was the production editor for this
edition of the book, taking over the job from John Files,
who produced the first edition.  Nicole coordinated the
entire production process, entered changes from edited copy,
and handled the meticulous task of fixing line and page
breaks in the manuscript.
Madeleine Newell provided production assistance.
Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary, Jane Ellin, and Sheryl Avruch performed
quality control checks. Seth Maislin wrote the index.
Chris Reilley created the figures, including all the
detailed class hierarchy diagrams in Part V.

Edie Freedman designed the cover. Nancy Priest designed the
interior format of the book and Lenny Muellner carefully
implemented the format in <I CLASS=emphasis>troff</I>, with help from
Ellen Siever.

<blockquote class=footnote>
<P CLASS=para>[1] 
The hierarchy diagrams are loosely based on similar
diagrams for Java 1.0 by Charles L. Perkins.

<P CLASS=para>
The whole production team has my thanks for once again pulling together all the
pieces to create the finished product you now hold in your
hands.

<P CLASS=para>
As always, my thanks and love to Christie.
