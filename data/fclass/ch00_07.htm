<P CLASS=para>
Mark would like to acknowledge the patience, love, and support that
his wonderful wife Ginni provided during the long months he spent
writing this book. I also want to thank my daughters Rachel and Shana
for their understanding when they had to compete with this book for my
attention. I also want to thank Mike Loukides and Andy Cohen for
their valuable suggestions on the content of this book. I particularly
want to thank Paula Ferguson, who spent many long hours above and
beyond the call of duty poring over the details of this book to edit
it into its final form.

<P CLASS=para>
Jonathan sends many thanks to Kristen, who helps him reach for his
dreams and does a lot of proofreading, too. To Daphne, thanks for
reminding me every day exactly how great it is to work at home. To my
cats, Asher and Basteet, thanks for attending my meetings and helping
me type. Thanks also to Paula Ferguson for her unflagging attention
to detail.

<P CLASS=para>
The class hierarchy diagrams in this book were borrowed from David
Flanagan's book, <i CLASS=citetitle>Java in a Nutshell</i>.
These diagrams were based on similar diagrams for Java 1.1 by Charles
L. Perkins.

<P CLASS=para>
Finally, a big round of applause to the design and production staff at
O'Reilly &amp; Associates for putting out this tome on a very tight
schedule. Mary Anne Weeks Mayo was the production manager. Quality was
assured through the services of Ellie Fountain Maden and Sheryl
Avruch. Seth Maislin wrote the index. Erik Ray, Ellen Siever, and
Lenny Muellner contributed their tool-tweaking prowess. Chris Reilley
was responsible for illustrations, Nancy Priest for the interior
design, Hanna Dyer created the back cover, and Edie Freedman designed
the front cover.
