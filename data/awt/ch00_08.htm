<P CLASS=para>
I am grateful to many people who helped me along while working on this 
book, especially my wife, Lisa, and her patience during this whole process. 
A special thanks goes to our Old English sheep dog, Sir Dudley Fuzzybuns 
McDuff for gladly sharing the house with me during the entire process. I 
am grateful to the people at Sun who helped me become involved with 
Java so early on: Pete Seymour, Anne Pettitt, Tom McGinn, and Jen 
Sullivan-Volpe. I am also grateful to my employers, Rapid Systems Solutions 
(when I started) and the MageLang Institute (when I finished), who let 
me work on the book. Another thanks goes out to Dale Carnegie Training 
and John Captain, whose human relations class helped me feel comfortable 
with public speaking, without which I would not have become immersed in 
Java so quickly. 

<P CLASS=para>
Particular thanks are owed to the technical reviewers: Yadu Zambre, Andy 
Cohen, David Flanagan, Jen Sullivan-Volpe, and Dan Jacobs. All of them 
performed an invaluable service with their thorough reviews and helped 
spot my errors and omissions. It seemed everyone contributed many bits 
of text that eventually found their way into the final product. 

<P CLASS=para>
Random thanks go out to the many people on the Internet who I never met 
but provided valuable information, from the newsgroups and mailing lists: 
Simon "FISH" Morris, Mike Gallant, Eric Link, and many others whose names 
I did not write down. 

<P CLASS=para>
Bits and pieces of various figures were borrowed from David Flanagan's 
book, <I CLASS=emphasis>Java in a Nutshell</I>, 
and Patrick Niemeyer's and Joshua Peck's book, <I CLASS=emphasis>Exploring 
Java</I>. The class hierarchy diagrams 
come from David's book. These diagrams were based on similar diagrams 
by Charles L. Perkins. His original efforts are available at 
<A HREF="http://rendezvous.com/java/">http://rendezvous.com/java/</A>. 

<P CLASS=para>
For the gang at O'Reilly who gave me the opportunity to write
this work, I thank everyone who helped along the way. For series
editor, Mike Loukides, thanks for all your time and effort, especially
with the early drafts. Best of luck to Mike and Judy with their new
bundle of joy, Alexandra.  Special thanks to Jonathan Knudsen who
updated the reference section for the new release. Thanks to Nancy
Crumpton and John Files for book production and project management,
and to Trina Jackson, Paula Ferguson, and Andy Oram who helped during
the review stages. Thanks also to the O'Reilly Tools group, Ellen
Siever, Erik Ray, and Lenny Muellner; to Seth Maislin, the indexer;
and David Futato and Danny Marcus who handled the proofreading and
QCs.

<P CLASS=para>
The final product is much better because of their help.
