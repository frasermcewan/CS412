Using our system:
To use our system you will need to add certain Lucene and JSoup packages to the programs build path before running the main. The required packages(assuming you are using Lucene 5.4.0) are:
lucene-core-5.4.0
lucene-demo-5.4.0
lucene-analyzers-common-5.4.0
lucene-queryparser-5.4.0
lucene-backward-codecs-5.4.0

These can all be gained by downloading lucene at: https://lucene.apache.org/
You will also need a .jar called jsoup-1.8.3 which can be gained at: http://jsoup.org/
